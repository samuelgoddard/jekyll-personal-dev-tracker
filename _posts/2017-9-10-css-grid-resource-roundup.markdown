<p class="f--m">
  Now CSS grid has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement">decent support</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/enhancing-css-layout-floats-flexbox-grid">graceful progressive fallbacks</a> for non-evergreen browsers, I recently did some research into it's shiney new features. Rather than try and write my our own spin on "why CSS Grid is great!", we decided to put together a quick roundup of some of the best resources on the internet for CSS grid.
</p>

CSS Grid can be used to create elaborate grid layouts, reminiscent of print layout. Although it's been around a while now, only recently has it become *ready* for production sites. MDN recently puplished a document about [CSS Grid Layout and Progressive Enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement) that reflects on this further. With this in mind, now seems like a great time to start getting to grips with CSS Grid.
