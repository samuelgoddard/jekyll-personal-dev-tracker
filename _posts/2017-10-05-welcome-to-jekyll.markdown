<p class="f--m">It is pretty likely that you’ve heard of WordPress - originally developed as a blogging platform, it’s now one of the most popular platforms around, but with a plethora of other options available, is it really the best solution for you?</p>

Alongside WordPress, there’s an ever growing list of popular Content Management Systems, such as Joomla, Drupal, Squarespace, the list goes on… and on… and on. Fortunately, [Craft](http://www.example.com) came along and made our decision much easier.

### WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source CMS based on PHP and MySQL. It was released in 2003 and was originally developed as a blogging platform, not a CMS. It’s now one of the most popular CMS platforms, with [around 27% of the entire internet being powered by it](http://www.example.com). It is often considered one of the easiest to use CMS platforms with vast amounts of tutorials and documentation available online.

### Craft

Craft CMS brags that it is a “content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike”. It’s entire codebase is viewable on Github and is built on the high performance PHP framework Yii. Craft’s strength lies in its ability to display and relate almost any kind of content you can throw at it, its platform is incredibly versatile and perfect for developing a unique system that is completely tailored to each individual client’s needs.

Although not as popular as WordPress, Craft has seen a huge rise in popularity over the past year and in our opinion stacks up very well against the industry leaders.

## Security

Website security is a vital consideration for any reputable business’s online presence and is something that is often overlooked. CMS platforms rely on being constantly updated, often leaving them prone to security flaws.

### Wordpress

WordPress still currently supports [PHP 5.2.4+](http://www.example.com) which has officially reached End Of Life status, sites built on this kind of legacy environment will be exposed to a broad range of security vulnerabilities. This combined with its heavy reliance on plugins, means it is often a target for hackers through inherent vulnerabilities in out-of-date codebase. The combination of need for plugins (to expand WordPress's core functionality) and a community largely made up of hobbyists and do-it-yourself website owners mean plugins need regularly updating due to out-of-date or poor code.

Core WordPress updates are released on average once a month and are always free. If you’re using plugins they will need regularly, individually updating, this can become cumbersome but regular maintenance is necessary due to the aforementioned security issues.

[Sucuri released a hacked website report](http://www.example.com) for the first 2 quarters of 2016 which showed that out of 9,771 infected websites, WordPress was the platform of choice for 74% of them, highlighting just how targeted and insecure WordPress is as a platform.

### Craft

Craft is built on the fast, secure and professional PHP framework Yii. Yii embraces the best practises and protocols commonly found in modern web application development meaning you’ll be much more secure and your web developer will love you.

All version updates are included in your license fee and are released regularly. Updates for the core product and plugins alike are installed by the click of a single button.

This is the part where I’d put the percentage of infected Craft driven websites from the Sucuri report above, unfortunately, there weren’t any… :)
